Most of it can be boiled down into several industry basics that not only do teams not follow, but a surprising amount of large corporations. The slides for the t... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Forensics Laboratory - Frameworks, Attestations and Accreditations</title><link href="http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-frameworks-attestations-and-accreditations/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Forensics Laboratory - Frameworks, Attestations and Accreditations" /><published>2023-02-15T20:45:00-08:00</published> <updated>2023-02-15T21:55:49-08:00</updated> <id>http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-frameworks-attestations-and-accreditations/</id> <content src="http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-frameworks-attestations-and-accreditations/" /> <author> <name>Turb0Yoda</name> </author> <summary> Introduction Happy New Years! To kick the New Year off, we’re gonna talk about probably the worst part, in my opinion, of running one of these bad boys- AUDITS. I will try to fake as much enthusiasm as I can, but I know all too well how boring this part is. This is not intended to be any sort of replacement or guide to set up your environment to the standards mentioned within, but to show you ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Forensics Laboratory - Forensic Software</title><link href="http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-software/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Forensics Laboratory - Forensic Software" /><published>2022-11-24T18:42:00-08:00</published> <updated>2023-02-15T21:03:18-08:00</updated> <id>http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-software/</id> <content src="http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-software/" /> <author> <name>Turb0Yoda</name> </author> <summary> Introduction If I’ve seen anything close to divisive in the industry, it’s the software forensicators use in their day-to-day work. A lot of tools come and go, and a lot remain giants in the field. I don’t intend this as an end-all-be-all list of tools you’ll see in a lab, but maybe more of the more popular/often used tools, closed-source or open-source, extremely pricey or free-99. At the end... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Forensics Laboratory - Networking Sucks</title><link href="http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-networking-sucks/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Forensics Laboratory - Networking Sucks" /><published>2022-10-28T19:27:00-07:00</published> <updated>2023-02-15T21:42:08-08:00</updated> <id>http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-networking-sucks/</id> <content src="http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-networking-sucks/" /> <author> <name>Turb0Yoda</name> </author> <summary> Introduction I despise networking with a passion. Not because it’s overtly complicated.. which it is. It’s because I have the absolute worst luck with hardware and making simple configurations work, like when I bricked a Juniper switch by setting a port to trunk. I don’t know how it happened or why, but I do know it’s what led to that being tossed in the bin. Nevertheless, this cursed subject... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Forensics Laboratory - The Building Blocks - Hardware Pt. 2</title><link href="http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-hardware-pt2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Forensics Laboratory - The Building Blocks - Hardware Pt. 2" /><published>2022-08-22T21:20:00-07:00</published> <updated>2023-02-15T21:03:18-08:00</updated> <id>http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-hardware-pt2/</id> <content src="http://turb0yoda.com/posts/forensic-laboratory-the-building-blocks-hardware-pt2/" /> <author> <name>Turb0Yoda</name> </author> <summary> Introduction This is the second part of the blog post about the hardware needed in a forensics lab. This will all be about the smaller gear and adapters and other miscellaneous stuff you might need. By no means is this comprehensive, partially because my memory is garbage, partially because you will need different gear for different things. A lab specializing in or providing vehicle forensic se... </summary> </entry> </feed>
